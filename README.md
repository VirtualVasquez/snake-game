# Vanilla JavaScript Snake Game

The timeless classic *Snake* game made in HTML, CSS and JavsScript.

Control the snake using the arrow keys. Eat as many apples as you can without hitting the borders or yourself!

## Summary

This deceptively simple game still take quite a bit of logic to get it to operate properly. While working on this project, I learned about deep-cloning arrays to help make the snake move, as well as the HTML canvas element where all the action takes place. 

Play as long as you like. You'll inevitably lose. Have a good laugh at the game over screen.
